# WUAWrapper
Â©2017 Eugene Odeluga  
This is a Windows Update API wrapper for Windows PowerShell  
It wraps some of the functions of the WU API contained in the Windows WUApiLib.dll library (not included) into a PS Cmdlet module called WUWrapper  
The Cmdlets allow the management of Windows Update through PowerShell for local and remote machines (needs admin)  
  
Current Cmdlet list:
    
    Get-WUUpdateHistory
    Receive-WUUpdate
